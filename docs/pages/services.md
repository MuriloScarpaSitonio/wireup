# Services

A service in Wireup is any class or function decorated with `@service`. 
Services can live anywhere but must be registered with the container.

When creating a container, you can use the `service_module` parameter to pass a list of modules which Wireup
will recursively scan for services, or pass them individually to the `services` parameter.

## Class Services

The simplest way to define a service is with a class:

```python
from wireup import service

@service
class VehicleRepository: ...

@service
class RentalService:
    # VehicleRepository is automatically injected
    def __init__(self, repository: VehicleRepository) -> None: ...
```

## Factory Services

For cases that require initialization, cleanup or classes that you don't control and cannot annotate, use factories. 
These are regular functions decorated with `@service` that construct and return service instances. The function must have a return
type. Wireup uses this to figure out what kind of service the factory creates.

```python
@service
def weather_client_factory() -> Iterator[WeatherClient]:
    with requests.Session() as session:
        yield WeatherClient(client=session)
```

## Dependency Resolution

Wireup uses type annotations to resolve dependencies. Parameter names are for readability only:

```python
# These are equivalent:
@service
def create_rental_service(repo: VehicleRepository) -> RentalService:
    return RentalService(repo)

@service
def create_rental_service(vehicle_store: VehicleRepository) -> RentalService:
    return RentalService(vehicle_store)
```


!!! tip
    You might have noticed the use of `Injected[T]` in the documentation.
    In Wireup's own services, this is not necessary because Wireup assumes ownership of all dependencies for its services.
    However, this may not be the case when injecting into functions, as some arguments might be provided by other decorators or callers.

    When injecting into a function, Wireup requires the `Injected[T]` syntax to make it explicit that it should
    inject that parameter. This ensures that if the requested dependency is not known,
    an error is raised instead of silently skipping the parameter.
