# Service Lifetimes

Wireup manages how long service instances live through three different lifetimes: Singleton, Scoped, and Transient. Configure the lifetime using the `lifetime` parameter in the `@service` decorator.

## Available Lifetimes

### Singleton (Default)
One instance is created and shared across the entire application.

```python
@service  # lifetime="singleton" is the default
class Database: ...

# Same instance everywhere
db1 = container.get(Database)
db2 = container.get(Database)
assert db1 is db2
```

Best for:

* Stateful services.
* Resource-intensive services.
* Configuration holders.

### Scoped
One instance per scope, shared within that scope.

```python
@service(lifetime="scoped")
class RequestContext: ...

with container.enter_scope() as scope1, container.enter_scope() as scope2:
    # Same instance within scope
    ctx1 = scope1.get(RequestContext)
    ctx2 = scope1.get(RequestContext)
    assert ctx1 is ctx2

    # Different instance in different scope
    other = scope2.get(RequestContext)
    assert ctx1 is not other
```

Best for:

* Request-specific services.
* Per-operation state.
* Database transactions.

!!! info
    Wireup integrations manage the scope lifecycle for you. 
    A new scope is entered at the beginning of a request and exited at the end. 
    This means that a `scoped` service will live for the duration of the request.

    The Wireup `@wireup.inject_from_container(container)` decorator can also enter/exit a scope after the decorated function returns.

!!! tip "Error Handling in Scoped Services"
    When using [generator factory functions](factory_functions.md#generator-functions-for-resource-management) 
    with scoped lifetime, errors that occur anywhere within the scope are automatically propagated to the factories. 
    This enables proper error handling, such as rolling back database transactions or cleaning up resources
    when operations fail.
    [Learn more about error propagation](factory_functions.md#error-handling-and-rollback).

### Transient
New instance created on every request.

```python
@service(lifetime="transient")
class MessageBuilder: ...

with container.enter_scope() as scope:
    # New instance every time
    builder1 = scope.get(MessageBuilder)
    builder2 = scope.get(MessageBuilder)
    assert builder1 is not builder2
```

Best for:

* Stateless services.
* Services that need fresh state.
* Temporary resources.

!!! warning "Scope Required"
    Transient services must be resolved within a scope, even if they don't use scoped dependencies.
    This ensures proper cleanup of resources if the transient service itself or one of its dependencies
    needs to perform cleanup.


## Lifetime Rules

* Singletons can depend only on other singletons.
* Scoped and transient services can depend on any lifetime.
* Parameters can be injected into all lifetimes.

!!! tip "Choosing a Lifetime"
    * Start with singleton unless you have a reason not to.
    * Use scoped for request-specific state.
    * Use transient for fresh instances or temporary resources.

#### Scoped services and decorated functions

Wireup lets you apply the container as a decorator. The provided integrations also decorate for you the routes/views
where Wireup services are used.

For such cases, you don't need to do any scope management yourself and can simply ask for the scoped/transient services
in the function's signature. The decorator can enter a scope and exit it once the function returns.
