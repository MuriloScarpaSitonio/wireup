# Class-Based Handlers for AIOHTTP

Class-based handlers in Wireup provide a new mechanism for efficient dependency injection for AIOHTTP applications. 
They optimize performance by managing dependencies at startup rather than per request.
Dependencies injected in the init method are zero-cost.

### Key Benefits

- **Request Performance**: Zero overhead from dependency resolution during request handling.
- **Stateful Handlers**: Maintain state across requests.
- **Route set**: Group relevant resource endpoints together

### Example

```python title="greeter.py"
class GreeterHandler:
    router = web.RouteTableDef() #(1)!

    def __init__(self, greeter: GreeterService) -> None: #(2)!
        self.greeter = greeter
        self.counter = 0

    @router.get("/greet")
    async def get_thing(
        self,
        request: web.Request, #(3)!
        auth_service: Injected[AuthenticationService] #(4)!
    ) -> web.Response:
        self.counter += 1

        return web.json_response({
            "greeting": self.greeter.greet(request.query.get("name", "world")),
            "counter": self.counter,
        })
```


1. The class must contain a `web.RouteTableDef` instance named `router`. Use it to decorate routes inside this class.
2. When injecting in the constructor the `Injected` syntax is not required.
3. Like every AIOHTTP request handler, the first argument must be `web.Request`.
4. Other scoped/transient dependencies can be requested in the routes. Here the `Injected[T]` annotation is required.


```python title="app.py"
wireup.integration.aiohttp.setup(
    container,
    app,
    handlers=[GreeterHandler]
)
```

**Overriding**: Since handlers are created once on startup, their dependencies cannot be overridden once the application
starts. If you need to override dependencies in the handler's init, then it must be done before application
startup.
